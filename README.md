# Hangman

The purpose of this game is to try and guess the word. The player will have six chanses to guess correctly, if they make a wrong guess there will be more and more body parts added to the hangman until it is complete and at that time the player has lost the game. 

## User stories

As a visiting user I want know the word at the end of the game
As a visiting user I want to have different words each time I play

## Future features

In the future I would like to add different levels of diffculty so it can be more fitted for everyone.
